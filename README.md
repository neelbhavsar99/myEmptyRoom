# myEmptyRoom

We are a group of motivated Electrical and Computer Engineering students aiming to find connectivity with hardware and software technologies with the use of IoT sensors.

From MakeUofT makeathon 2019, we implemented a smart ecosystem device with a web application to find unoccupied rooms that have been booked. Targeted environments include corporate office rooms, university student centres and library rooms, individuals can simply walk in and find a room not occupied to save time and multiple other discrepancies.

## Save Time
You can simply walk-in and find any open spots for rooms that somoeone booked but did not show up to.

## Hassle Free
There is no additional steps to finding an empty room, simply observe the web application which constantly updates.

## More accessibility
On the web application, all the necessary information is posted with the most user-friendly interafce.
